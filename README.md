# CouchCoder

This is an in class assignment where we needed to use an API key, responsive framework and some unique styling to produce a New York Times Artcile Search Website. We were in a team of 4, we split the work up in teams of two. I and my partner were in charge of the front end, and we used some fun Boostrap and background images to make our page very unique. We did help with the back end problem solving as we neared presenttion time. All of our heads needed to come together to solve the errors we encountered when the two teams tried to join the code we had written. Our team name was the Couch Coder which is why we implemented a couch icon and we used a cool backgorund image of newspaper and faded it to create a really nice affect on the page. Our use of color and font was pleasing to the eye and professional.
